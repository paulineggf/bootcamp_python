"""Computes the mean squared error of two non-empty numpy.ndarray,
without any for loop. The two arrays must have the same dimensions.
    Args:
     y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
     y_hat: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector.
    Returns:
     The mean squared error of the two vectors as a float.
     None if y or y_hat are empty numpy.ndarray.
     None if y and y_hat does not share the same dimensions.
    Raises:
     This function should not raise any Exception.
